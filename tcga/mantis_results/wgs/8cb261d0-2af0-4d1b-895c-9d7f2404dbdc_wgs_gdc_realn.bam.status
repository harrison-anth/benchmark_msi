Average Metric Value (Abbr)	Value	Threshold	Status
Step-Wise Difference (DIF)	0.4348	0.4000   	Unstable
Euclidean Distance (EUC)	0.2626	0.1870   	Unstable
Cosine Dissimilarity (COS)	0.0786	0.0700   	Unstable

Note: The authors recommend the use of the Step-Wise Difference
metric for determining the status of the sample. Any value greater
than or equal to the threshold is called unstable.
