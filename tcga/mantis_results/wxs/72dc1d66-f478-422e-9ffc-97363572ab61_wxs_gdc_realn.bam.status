Average Metric Value (Abbr)	Value	Threshold	Status
Step-Wise Difference (DIF)	0.2699	0.4000   	Stable
Euclidean Distance (EUC)	0.1479	0.1870   	Stable
Cosine Dissimilarity (COS)	0.0332	0.0700   	Stable

Note: The authors recommend the use of the Step-Wise Difference
metric for determining the status of the sample. Any value greater
than or equal to the threshold is called unstable.
